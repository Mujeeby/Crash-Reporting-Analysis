# Crash Reporting Data Analysis – Capstone Project



<img src="Dashboard Screenshot.png">

## Overview

This capstone project, completed in collaboration with a 3-member team at SAIT, focuses on analyzing over 97,000 crash records from Montgomery County, Maryland. The primary objective was to uncover traffic trends, identify high-risk conditions, and develop data-driven strategies for reducing traffic incidents using a comprehensive data analytics pipeline.

## Team Members

- **Mujeeb Adedolapo Yusuf** 
- **Priti** 
- **Yuvraj Singh**

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – Data cleaning, date-time parsing, predictive modeling
- **SQL Server / SSMS** – Querying, data manipulation
- **SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)** – Data transformation pipeline
- **Power BI** – Visualizations and dashboard creation
- **Excel** – Initial data exploration and cleaning

## Key Questions Addressed

- How do collisions vary by season, weather, and road conditions?
- Which roads and vehicle types contribute most to accidents?
- What role do distraction, substance abuse, and speed limits play in crash severity?
- How can predictive modeling assist in resource allocation and prevention?

## Highlights

- Identified Georgia Avenue as a recurring high-risk location.
- Discovered clear weather and fall months show unexpectedly high crash rates.
- Created a predictive model using Random Forest to forecast potential collision spikes.
- Suggested actionable policies for DUI enforcement, distracted driving, and targeted infrastructure upgrades.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data can guide smarter public safety strategies. It reflects strong technical skills across the full data analytics lifecycle — from cleaning and transformation to modeling and communication.
